# ECSG - The Friendly CSG Plugin

This plugin is a collection of custom CSG compatible presets, generators and utilities to speed up whiteboxing. 

# Alpha 2

This plugin is freshly created. It is not stable by any means. Please make sure to backup any work before using this plugin or use it in a freshly created project only.
Feel free to open an issue if you encounter bugs or odd behaviour. This plugin was made for Godot 3.4. Other versions may work as well.

# More to come

I will add more presets and functionality. Make sure to check for updates.

# Known Issues

- The spatial gizmos (the small circles and squares in the editor) don't update immedietly, will be fix soon
- The properties of object, edited in editor with handles, may not update immedietly, will be fix shorty
- You need a root spatial node in the scene tree to add shapes, the error message only shows in the console, a popup notification will be added soon

# Contribution

Feel free to provide your own shape presets. A tutorial how to create one, will come with the stable release
